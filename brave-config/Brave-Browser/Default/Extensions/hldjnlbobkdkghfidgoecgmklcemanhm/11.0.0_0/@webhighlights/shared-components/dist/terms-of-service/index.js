                    2.1 In order to use the Service, you must firstly agree to
                    the Terms. You may not use the Service if you do not accept

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2.2 You can accept the Terms by simply using the Service.
                    You understand and agree that Web Highlights will treat your
                    use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that
                    point onwards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2.3 You may not use the Service and may not accept the Terms
                    if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract
                    with Web Highlights and are not above age of 13, or (b) you
                    are a person who is either barred or otherwise legally

                    Web Highlights reserves the right to make changes the Terms
                    from time to time, for example to address changes to the law
                    or regulatory changes or changes to functionality offered
                    through the Service. Therefore you must look at the Terms
                    regularly to check for such changes. The modified version of
                    the Terms (the “Modified Terms”) will be posted at
                    https://web-highlights.com/legal/terms-of-service or made
                    available within the Service (for any modified additional
                    terms). If you do not agree to the Modified Terms you must
                    stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service
                    after the date the Modified Terms are posted will constitute
                    your acceptance of the Modified Terms.
