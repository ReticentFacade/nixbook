                    Web Highlights provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of
                    our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use,
                    disclosure and protection of information that apply to our
                    Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection
                    and use of information. We take the privacy of our users
                    very seriously. We do not sell your personal data, neither
                    your email address, nor any personal information on how you
                    use Web Highlights to external parties. We also do not store
                    users’ browsing history, except for the pages you
                    specifically highlight/annotate/bookmark to our servers.

                  <h3 class="terms-section-title">2. CHILDREN</h3>
                  <p>
                    Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to enjoy Web
                    Highlights’s services. For children under 13, in the future,
                    Web Highlights will offer a limited feature set and website
                    experience. If we receive any reports from the user or from
                    user’s teacher that the user is under the age of 13, we will
                    terminate the service now and in the future may offer a
                    limited version of the website that removes social features
                    such as a public profile if we plan to implement a public
                    profile in the future.

                    To use the Web Highlights service, an email address,
                    username and password are required. That’s it. We use
                    personally identifiable information to deliver the Service,
                    to comply with reasonable requests of law enforcement and
                    recommend additional content to you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We collect information that can be used to identify you as
                    an individual (“Personally Identifiable Information”) only
                    when you provide such information directly to us in
                    connection with the Service. We ask for Personally
                    Identifiable Information such as your name and e-mail
                    address when you register for the Service, or if you
                    correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our
                    responses). We use reasonable measures to protect member
                    information that is stored within our database, and we
                    restrict access to member information to those employees who

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Web Highlights may provide a referral service that allows
                    you to invite your friends and contacts to use Web
                    Highlights. We may integrate the Platform with third party
                    sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation
                    messages or requests for references via the third party site
                    itself. You may also send invitation/request emails via the
                    Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the
                    contact information to which to send your
                    invitation/request. You can type in the email addresses or
                    other contact information manually, or you can choose to
                    import the contacts in your address book(s). In both cases,
                    we may use and store this information for the sole purposes
                    of allowing you to send your friends and contacts an
                    invitation or request for a reference, and for fraud
                    detection and prevention. With respect to referrals, we will
                    also store the email addresses of your invitees to track if
                    your friend joins Web Highlights in response to your
                    referral.
